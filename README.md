# Bay-Area-Collision-Analysis
### Utilizing data analytics to identify high-risk locations, collision patterns, and contributing factors, informing targeted road safety interventions for San Francisco's Vision Zero initiative.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze traffic collision data in the San Francisco Bay Area. By identifying high-risk locations, collision patterns, and contributing factors, we inform targeted road safety interventions for the Vision Zero initiative.

## Business Objectives
1. **Objective 1:** Analyze traffic collision data to identify high-risk locations and patterns.
2. **Objective 2:** Provide insights to inform targeted road safety interventions.

## Project Repository Structure

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Overall Traffic Safety Overview**:
   - Visualize traffic collisions and incidents over time.

2. **Positive Community Feedback**:
   - Community feedback analysis and visualization.

3. **Incident Reduction Analysis**:
   - Analysis of collision reduction over time.

4. **High-Risk Locations Identification**:
   - Map visualization highlighting high-risk collision locations.

## Predictive & Analytical Models
1. **Traffic Collision Heatmap Analysis (R Markdown)**:
   - **Objective**: Visualize collision density using heatmaps.

Here, The density plot map indicates a higher concentration of severe injuries and fatalities within the central San Francisco area, suggesting a potential need for increased traffic safety measures in this densely populated region on the eastern part of SF.

2. **Sentiment Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**:
   - **Objective**: Analyze sentiment of traffic-related reports.

3. **Tableau Dashboard Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive visualization of collision data.
